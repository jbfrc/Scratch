# Scratch-Private

These files have been used when I've taught [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming. This was done as part of a Programming Merit Badge class, as a coach for [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/), and at other summer programs for elementary and middle school students. I'm cleaning these files up now and adding others over the next few weeks.
